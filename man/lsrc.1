.Sh DESCRIPTION
This program lists all configuration files, both the sources in the
dotfiles directories and the destinations in your home directory.
.
See
.Xr rcup 1 ,
the
.Sx DIRECTORY LAYOUT
section, for details on the directory layout.
.
It supports these options:
.
.Bl -tag -width "-I excl_pat"
.It Fl d Ar DIR
list dotfiles from the DIR. This can be specified multiple times.
.
.It Fl F
show symbols next to each file indicating status information. Supported
symbols are
.Li @
which indicates that the file is a symlink,
.Li $
which indicates it's a symlinked directory, and
.Li X
to indicate that the file is a copy. More details on copied files and
symlinked directories can be found in
.Xr rcrc 5
under the documentation on
.Va COPY_ALWAYS
and
.Va SYMLINK_DIRS ,
respectively.
.
.It Fl I Ar excl_pat
include the files that match the given pattern. This is applied after
any
.Fl x
options. It uses the same pattern language as
.Fl x ;
more details are in the
.Sx EXCLUDE PATTERN
section.
.
.It Fl S Ar excl_pat
symlink the directory that match the given pattern. See
.Sx EXCLUDE PATTERN
for more details. This option can be repeated.
.
.It Fl t Ar TAG
list dotfiles according to TAG
.
.It Fl v
increase verbosity. This can be repeated for extra verbosity.
.
.It Fl q
decrease verbosity
.
.It Fl x Ar excl_pat
exclude the files that match the given pattern. See
.Sx EXCLUDE PATTERN
for more details. This option can be repeated.
.
.It Ar files ...
only list the specified file(s)
.El
.Sh EXCLUDE PATTERN
The exclude pattern specifies a colon-separated pair of dotfiles
directory and file glob. The dotfiles directory is optional and, if
omitted, defaults to
.Li * ,
which is a special token that matches any dotfiles directory. The file
glob is relative to the dotfiles directory, ignoring meta directories. A
colon combines them.
.
.Pp
For example, to ignore all emacs-related items from the
.Pa thoughtbot-dotfiles
directory, use the exclude pattern:
.Pp
.Dl thoughtbot-dotfiles:*emacs*
.Pp
To ignore any
.Pa bash_profile
file, use the pattern:
.Pp
.Dl *:bash_profile
.Pp
Or more simply:
.Pp
.Dl bash_profile
.Pp
See the caveats noted in
.Sx BUGS
when using an exclude pattern.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width ".Ev RCRC"
.It Ev RCRC
User configuration file. Defaults to
.Pa ~/.rcrc .

.Sh BUGS
There are a few bugs around shell globs. Anything involving an exclude
pattern is unpredictable, so use
.Fl v
when dealing with patterns. Specifically, globs may expand at any
time and remain expanded for the duration of the run, which means they
cannot be applied more than once. In addition, globs involving
relative directory names do not work.
