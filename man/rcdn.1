.Sh DESCRIPTION
This program will remove all the rc files that the
.Xr rcm 7
suite knows about. This can be further controlled with the
.Fl t
and
.Fl d
flags.
.Pp
The files that are removed are symlinks. However, the
.Va COPY_ALWAYS
setting in
.Xr rcrc 5
modifies this. If a rc file is not a symlink but an ancestor directory
is, that directory is removed. If a rc file is not a symlink but is
listed in
.Va COPY_ALWAYS
the file is removed.
.Pp
The
.Nm
program will run hooks before and after removing files, if these hooks
exist. Hooks are executable programs inside the dotfiles directory, with
the following names:
.Pa hooks/pre-down and
.Pa hooks/post-down .
These hooks are run each time
.Nm
is run and therefore must be idempotent.
.
.Bl -tag -width "-I EXCL_PAT"
.It Fl B Ar HOSTNAME

.Pa host-HOSTNAME
as the host-specific directory instead of computing it
.It Fl d Ar DIR

This can be repeated with additional patterns. See

.Sx EXCLUDE PATTERN ,
for more details.
.It Fl K
skip pre- and post-hooks
.It Fl k
run pre- and post-hooks. This is the default.
.It Fl q
decrease verbosity
.It Fl S Ar EXCL_PAT
